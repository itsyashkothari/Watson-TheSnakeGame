3D version of classic snakes!



# Help

1)Snake can move in 6 direction. left,right,towards you, away from you ,top and down.
{
	Left: 'a' key,
	Right: 'd' key,
	away: 'w' key,
	towards you :'s' key,
	top : 'up' key,
	down : 'down' key
}
2)camera can see from 4 sides.To move camera to right side press 'right arrow' key and similarly for left.
Snake movement is relative. That is 'Left','Right',Away' and 'Towards' will depend on the side you are seeing from .
I suggest play the game atleast 3-4 times to get hang of it.
3)Game can end in 2 ways
	i)Snake eats itself-1)You press key opposite to the dirction it is moving i.e. If the snake is moving left and you press 'd' , game will get over.
						2)Head of snake touches other part sideways.
	ii)You touch the invisible walls, which are at double the distance from the cube whose edges are marked.
4)Initial length is 15 and it will increase when snake eats food.
5)To restart game, refresh the page (Ctrl+'r').
